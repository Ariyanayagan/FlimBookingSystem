# ðŸŽ¦ Film Ticket Booking System API

This is a .NET Core 8.0 Web API for a Film Ticket Booking System integrated with a PostgreSQL database using Entity Framework Core (EF Core). The system allows users to browse available films, select showtimes, hold tickets, and complete bookings. Administrators have additional permissions to manage films, showtimes, and view all bookings.

## Features ðŸš€

### Film and Showtime Management

- **Admin-only Features:**

  - Create films with details such as name, description, duration, amount, genre and showtimes.
  - Manage seating availability per showtime.

- **User Features:**
  - Browse films, filter by name and genre
  - Retrieve a list of all films and showtimes.

### Ticket Booking

- **Hold Ticket Logic:**

  - Hold tickets for a set period (e.g., 10 minutes). If the booking is not completed in time, the hold expires, and tickets are re-available.

- **Order Management:**
  - Users can view past bookings and upcoming shows, while admins can track all ticket sales per film/showtime.

### Authentication and Authorization

- JWT-based authentication with two roles:
  - **User:** Can browse films, book tickets, and view booking history.
  - **Admin:** Can manage films, showtimes, and seating availability, and view all bookings.
